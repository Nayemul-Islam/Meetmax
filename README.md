## ✨ Features

### 🧭 Responsive Design  
The entire UI is built using Tailwind CSS and React, ensuring that it adjusts seamlessly across all screen sizes—from desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones. This guarantees users a consistent and visually appealing experience regardless of the device.

### 🔐 User Authentication  
Users can securely sign up or log in using email and password. The app also supports social login (like Google), handled via Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, users can view restricted or personalized content.

### 🔄 Real-Time News Fetching  
News data is fetched from an external news API. Whenever new content is published, it's automatically reflected on the platform, eliminating the need for manual updates and ensuring users always see the latest articles.

### 🗂️ Category-Based Filtering  
The home page includes category links such as Politics, Sports, Business, Technology, and more. When a user selects a category, only the articles related to that topic are displayed. This enhances readability and user engagement.

### 📄 News Detail Page  
Users can click on any news card to view the complete article. The detail page displays a full-sized image, headline, source, author (if available), published time, and a full description. This feature mimics modern news websites and improves the reading experience.

### 👨‍💻 Clean Codebase & Modular Structure  
The project follows a modular folder structure for better maintainability. Components are reusable and well-organized, making it easy for future developers to navigate and scale the application.
